This is just going to be a complete example of how to create a level

levels are h = 9 tiles w = 11 tiles, could make larger or smaller based on whether or not you want to

We need to decide where each train car goes, each train car gets their own number, trains numbered go     0 steel - 11 normal one, normal one should be last one just to make matching numbers with ending slightly easier
And ending place     from steel?? 0 - 10 zebra thing
Same thing with track     from horizontal 0 - 20 for sw->ne right switch

tracks never go straight up/down, curves handle that

if you wanted to put multiple things on one tile you can separate it like so:
track:train:end

track numbers:
0 = left/right
1 = nw/se
2 = sw/ne
3 = curve left/ne
4 = curve nw/right
5 = curve ne/se
6 = curve sw/right
7 = curve left/se
8 = curve nw/sw
9 = left/right ne switch
10 = nw/se right switch
11 = ne/sw se switch
12 = right/left sw switch
13 = se/nw left switch
14 = sw/ne nw switch
15 = left/right se switch
16 = nw/se sw switch
17 = ne/sw left switch
18 = right/left nw switch
19 = se/nw ne switch
20 = sw/ne right switch

for train and ending numbers (arbitrary name, none given yet):
0 = red
1 = green
2 = blue
3 = 
4 = 
5 = 
6 = 
7 = 
8 = 
9 = 
10 = main train (train only) black

sample file size w = 11 h = 9 would look something like this:

level title
maybe level background image
